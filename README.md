If you enjoy sliding puzzles, here is a simple one for you to try. Use the empty tile to help you move different numbered tiles and sort them all out so they are ordered from 1 through 15!

### Current Features
* Charming 8-bit sound effects with each tile movement
* All boards are initially shuffled and ensured solveable, preventing the frustration of getting to the very end, only to find the last two tiles are ordered 15 and 14 forever.
* Snazzy color theme that invokes thoughts of cool creation apps you might have used as a kid - if smartphones and mobile apps were big in your day.

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs

* JavaScript: Handles all the game logic, including shuffling the initial board and deciding whether or not pieces can be moved.
* React.js: Used for quick and smooth handling of changes to the UI when a piece is moved.
* HTML/CSS: Makes everything look pretty.
